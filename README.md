Findings and Observations:
Basic Statistics:

The average age of the participants is around the median, with some variation seen in the dataset.
Numerical columns exhibit standard deviations indicating diverse responses, especially in age.
Gender-Based Analysis:

The mean age differs slightly between genders, indicating potential differences in age distribution.
Depression rates:
Certain gender groups show higher proportions of reported depression.
This could highlight gendered differences in mental health challenges or reporting tendencies.
Seeking Treatment:

On average, individuals who sought treatment tend to be slightly older. This might suggest a correlation between maturity and proactive mental health care.
Visual Insights:

Line Chart: The age trend over time suggests some clustering of data entries, but no strong chronological trends.
Bar Chart: Males, females, and other gender categories show differing average ages.
Histogram: The age distribution is unimodal and slightly skewed, with a peak around the median age.
Scatter Plot: There is no strong correlation between age and CGPA, though slight clustering suggests age might influence CGPA up to a point.
These findings can help understand patterns in the dataset and support conclusions about mental health trends in students.
